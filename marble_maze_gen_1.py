    # There are many different piece types, but will start with basics.
    # Support Tube: (Hollow Cylinder) Used as supports, also allow marble to fall through.
    # Support Base: (Cylinder with wider bottom) Always placed at bottom of support tower.
    # Track: (Two hollow cylinders, connected by u-shaped track angled down) Straight path from one tower to another
    # Start Funnel: (Hollow cylinder with wider top) starting point of maze.
    # End Collector: (Wide cylinder with circular path and support-sized entrance at top) for marbles to end in.

    # Planned order for creating:
    # Supports first
    # Bases at bottom of each support stack
    # Any connecting tracks placed at certain levels between stacks
    # Funnel at top of maze stack
    # Collector at end of maze
    
    # All pieces shoud have rigid body simulation; for now, none will be allowed to move.
    # A sphere (marble) should be able to roll down maze from start to end.
